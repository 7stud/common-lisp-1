# About

Since strings are [vectors][concept-vectors] which are sequences (both covered in other concepts) all functions that work on sequences will work on strings - such as `position`, `map`, `remove`, `concatenate` _etc._.

There are also more string specific functions to do things such as compare strings to see which is alphabetically more or less `string<` and `string>`; functions to trim characters from the left, right or both sides of a string (`string-trim`).
Refer to the [Hyperspec Section on strings][hyper-string] for full details.
