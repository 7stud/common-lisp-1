## Contributing To the Common Lisp Track

### Contributing Guide
 
Please be familiar with the
[contributing guide](https://github.com/exercism/x-api/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#the-exercise-data)
in the x-api repository. This describes how all the language tracks
are put together, as well as details about the common metadata, and
high-level information about contributing to existing problems and
adding new problems.

### Issues

Feel free to file any issues at
https://github.com/exercism/xlisp/issues for problems of any size.
Feel free to report typographical errors or poor wording for example.
You can greatly help improve the quality of the exercises by filing
reports of invalid solutions that pass tests or of valid solutions
that fail tests

### Development setup

Direct contributions to the Common Lisp code in xlisp are always
welcome. 
Refer to
[the Getting Started Guide](http://help.exercism.io/getting-started-with-lisp.html)
for the Common Lisp track to get your environment set up if needed.

New exercises or changes to existing ones can be submitted via a pull
request. You will need a GitHub account and you will need to fork
exercism/xlisp to your account. See
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) if you
are unfamiliar with the process.

A list of exercises yet to be created is in
[issue #23](https://github.com/exercism/xlisp/issues/23). This might
be a great place to get started.
