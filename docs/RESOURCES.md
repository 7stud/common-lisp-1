## Recommended Learning Resources

Exercism provides exercises and feedback but can be difficult to jump into for those learning Common Lisp for the first time. These resources can help you get started:

* [Cliki.net Getting Start Started Page](http://cliki.net/Getting%20Started), by various contributors
* [Wikibooks book of Common Lisp, First steps](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Common_Lisp/First_steps), by various contributors
* [Learn X in Y minutes: where X = Common Lisp](http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/common-lisp/) by Paul Nathan
* [Northwestern University EECS 325 Readings](http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/academics/courses/325/readings/readings.php), by Chris Riesbeck
* [The Common Lisp Cookbook](http://cl-cookbook.sourceforge.net/), by various contributors

There are many more excellent resources, most of them crosslinked in one of the pages above.

### Important resources

* [The Common Lisp HyperSpec](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/common-lisp.html), by X3J13 committee. The Common Lisp Standard
* [Common Lisp the Language, 2nd Edition](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/cltl2.html), by Guy Steele
* [Common Lisp Document Repository](http://cdr.eurolisp.org/) a collection of emergent and de-facto standards
* [Common-Lisp.net](http://common-lisp.net/), project hosting and gateway
* [The Common Lisp Wiki](http://www.cliki.net/)

### Free books

There are many other great books you can find links to. These are the most popularly linked introductory works.

* [Practical Common Lisp](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/), by Peter Seibel
* [Common Lisp: A Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation](http://www-cgi.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/dst/www/LispBook/index.html) (PDF), by David S. Touretzky
* [Common Lisp: An Interactive Approach](http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~shapiro/Commonlisp/) (PDF), by Stuart C. Shapiro
* [Successful Lisp: How to Understand and Use Common Lisp](http://psg.com/~dlamkins/sl/cover.html), by David B. Lamkins

Following these are two more advanced books, but beginners shouldn't be afraid of them, they're quite accessible and "classics".

* [On Lisp](http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisptext.html), by Paul Graham
* [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/), by Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman

The last is actually on a related Lisp dialect, Scheme, but it's very helpful book, generally. If you find you prefer Scheme, it's an excellent start.
